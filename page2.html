		<p>Similar to the government site, Amazon has a lot of information at once 
		but there is somethings that are unified together and visual interesting. 
		However, it has a lot of stuff, it has also some visual hierarchy issues. 
		But Amazon has simple typography and bold text that makes it very easy and 
		simple to navigate through the mass of information. It also has a lot of 
		visuals and products that are personalized and immediately graps my attention.</p>

		<p>I like to read the news a few times a day to keep myself busy when I have 
		nothing to do. This app is one of my favorite because the interface and the 
		way that guides my hand is easy. the sideway sliding was really useful for 
		someone who is lazy. I also like how its not at all glitchy and very calming 
		colors but yet has an urgengy to them. </p>
